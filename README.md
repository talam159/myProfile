## Professional Statement
I am Md Tanvirul Alam, a master’s student in Computer Science in Germany. I have worked for two years as a Senior Executive in IT and Network at a tech-based organization specializing in Public Key Infrastructure and Identity Solutions. My responsibilities included network administration, key management, performing backups, identity access management, and data center management. I am passionate about cybersecurity, cryptography, data privacy, compliance, cloud computing, and DevOps.

I completed [Foundations of Cybersecurity](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-of-cybersecurity) by Google on Coursera, which equipped me with fundamental knowledge of attack types, the importance of cybersecurity in business operations, security ethics, common tools used by security professionals, and the key responsibilities of a security professional. My ultimate goal is to become a security analyst, where I can integrate user-friendly interfaces and experiences with security requirements to achieve compliance for organizations and endpoint users.

My key strengths include problem-solving skills, strong analytical abilities, a quick learning aptitude, natural curiosity, and the ability to efficiently research and find solutions by leveraging resources to address challenges swiftly.

As of 2024, I am preparing for the `CompTIA Security+` and `CompTIA Network+` certifications, and I aim to gain more hands-on knowledge in ethical hacking, Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT), and security auditing.

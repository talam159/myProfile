## Professional Statements
I am Md Tanvirul Alam, a master's student in Computer Science in Germany. I have worked for 2 years as a Senior Executive in IT and Network in a tech-based organization who specializing in Public Key Infrastructure and Identity Solutions. My job responsibility involved Network Administration, Key Management, Performing backup, Identity Access Management, and datacenter management. I am passionate about cybersecurity, cryptography, data privacy, compliance, cloud computing and DevOps.

I have completed [Foundations of Cybersecurity](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-of-cybersecurity) by google on Coursera. This course equipped me with fundamental knowledge of attack types, the importance of cybersecurity in business operations, security ethics, common tools used by security professionals, and the key responsibilities of a security professional. My ultimate goal is to become a security analyst, where I can integrate user-friendly interfaces and experiences with security requirements to achieve compliance for organizations and endpoint users.

My key strengths include problem-solving skills, strong analytical abilities, a quick learning aptitude, natural curiosity and an ability to efficiently research and find solutions, leveraging resources to address challenges swiftly.

As of 2024, I am preparing for the `CompTIA Security+`, and `CompTIA Network+` certifications, and gather more hands-on knowledge about ethical hacking, Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT), and Security Audit.
